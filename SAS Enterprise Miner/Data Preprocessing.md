File Import	 
1. A File Import node was dragged to the diagram to import the file. I changed the file destination in Import File under Train. Once done, run the file import node.
2. To set up the correct role and level for dataset, I edit the variables by right clicking the node. A window popped up and I adjust the role and level as figure above. Once done, click OK.


Impute	 
1. A Impute node was dragged to the diagram, and I connected the file import node to Impute node. Once done, run it.
2. After run, right click the Impute node and select edit variable. A window popped out, and I can select the columns that contain missing values for imputation. I selected mean method for interval column and tree method for nominal method. Once done, click ok and run the node again.
